# Digital Dice using Verilog

# Overview
This project is a digital dice implemented using Verilog, which simulates a rolling dice and displays random numbers on a seven-segment display. It was developed as part of an Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) course to demonstrate proficiency in Verilog programming and digital circuit design.

## Features
- Generates random numbers between 1 to 6 to simulate a rolling dice.
- Controls a seven-segment display to show the dice number visually.

## Prerequisites
- A Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim) to run the code.
- Alternatively, an FPGA development board with a seven-segment display can be used for hardware implementation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run the simulation
4. Observe the simulation output or program the code on your FPGA board for hardware testing.

## Code Structure
The project consists of a single Verilog file named `Digital_Dice.v`, which contains the main logic for the digital dice.
